# Swift -- Open Source examples and prototypes
This repository is the open sources of all what I made by compiling on Swift 3 or higher version. 
If you know more detail information, please visit Wiki on this github or my blogs - http://synabreu.wordpress.com

1. AddToIntegers : This is the first swift project I've made ever. In reference, add two Integer numbers, and then print the sum of numbers, which is based on the console program on the macOS. 

2. HelloWorld : This program displays 'Hello World!' on the label by setting up diverse properties. For UI testing, I built this program based on the single view Project of iOS.  

3. InchesToCentimeters : Extending on testing a button handler, I built this program which exchanges from inches to centimeters. One of the most confusing things I lived in the United States was to change between Inches and Centimeters.
