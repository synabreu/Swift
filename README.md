# Swift -- Open Source examples and prototypes
This repository is about my open source examples and prototypes, which I compiled on Swift 3 or higher version. 
If you know more detail information, please visit Wiki on this github or my blogs - http://synabreu.wordpress.com

1. AddToIntegers : Just simple put! add two Integer numbers, and then print the sum of numbers, which is based on the console program on the macOS.

2. HelloWorld : This program displays 'Hello World!' on the label by setting up diverse properties. For UI testing, I built this program based on the single view Project of iOS.

3. InchesToCentimeters : Extending on testing a button handler, I built this prototype which exchanges from inches to centimeters. One of the most confusing things I lived in the United States was to change between Inches and Centimeters.

4. MyCal : This prototype is a mini calculator. I learned about how to figure out the user interface including autolayout, button handler, as well as how to use the types of enum, struct, class for performing operators and calcurating numbers.

5. TrafficSegues : This program displays two windows for only testing segues including Titles, Navigation items, and Buttons.

6. MyARBillBoard : This prototype is my first AR app on iOS11 Beta, showing Mt. Yosemiti on the billboard. This app was compiled by XCode 9 Beta 3.

7. MySiri : This prototype shows you to transform your voice into text messages both English and Korean languages using speechFramework. So this app was compiled by XCode 9 Beta 3 and Swift 4.
