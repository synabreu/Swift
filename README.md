# Swift -- Open Source examples and prototypes
This repository is the open sources of all what I made by compiling on Swift 3 or higher version. 
If you know more detail information, please visit Wiki on this github or my blogs - http://synabreu.wordpress.com

1. AddToIntegers : Just simple put! add two Integer numbers, and then print the sum of numbers, which is based on the console program on the macOS.

2. HelloWorld : This program displays 'Hello World!' on the label by setting up diverse properties. For UI testing, I built this program based on the single view Project of iOS.

3. InchesToCentimeters : Extending on testing a button handler, I built this program which exchanges from inches to centimeters. One of the most confusing things I lived in the United States was to change between Inches and Centimeters.
