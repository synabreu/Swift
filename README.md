# Swift
This repository is the open sources of all what I made by compiling on Swift 3 or higher version.

1. AddToIntegers : This is the first swift project I've made ever. In reference, add two Integer numbers, and then print the sum of numbers, which is based on the console program on the macOS. 

2. HelloWorld : This program displays 'Hello World!' on the label by setting up diverse properties. For UI testing, I built this program based on the single view Project of iOS.
